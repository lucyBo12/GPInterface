# Quality Assurance

## Corrections:

### Sprint 1

### Sprint 2

- Cosmo, Lucy and Sam changed login and registration windows to use layout managers rather that setBounds. All further windows should use layout managers

- Cosmo added password confirmation, disability and gender to registration field

    - Needed to add gender to the patient table design

- Cosmo implemented messaging functionality

    - Needed to add a message table to the database

### Sprint 3

- Cosmo significantly refactored to reduce code duplication

- Lucy added appointments table to the database for past appointment viewing feature

    - Could have added functionality into already existing booking table
