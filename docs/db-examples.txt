DATABASE EXAMPLES:

Below will go SQL queries to instantiate some examples of the designed classes.

Tests should generally be run after one of these has been used to set up the database. Suggest organising like:

    Add some patients:

    QUERY STUFF

    Add some doctors:

    DIFFERENT QUERY STUFF

<--- BEGIN --->

Set up tables:

CREATE TABLE Doctor (
    did INT PRIMARY KEY,
    forename VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    surname VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    phoneNumber VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Patient (
    pid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(40) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    forename VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    surname VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    dob DATE NOT NULL,
    gender CHAR(1),
    disabilities TEXT,
    doctor INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (doctor) REFERENCES Doctor(did),
    CONSTRAINT genderEnum CHECK (gender IN ('M', 'F', 'O'))
);

CREATE TABLE Login (
    pid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    hashed_pass CHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (pid) REFERENCES Patient(pid) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE Booking (
    bid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    reason TINYTEXT NOT NULL,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    time TIME NOT NULL,
    patient INT NOT NULL,
    doctor INT NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT doubleBooking UNIQUE (date, patient, doctor),
    FOREIGN KEY (patient) REFERENCES Patient(pid) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (doctor) REFERENCES Doctor(did)
);

CREATE TABLE Message (
    mid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    datetime DATETIME NOT NULL,
    contains TEXT NOT NULL,
    pid INT,
    did INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (pid) REFERENCES Patient(pid) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (did) REFERENCES Doctor(did),
    CONSTRAINT recipient CHECK (pid IS NOT NULL OR did IS NOT NULL)
);

CREATE TABLE PatientLog (
    lid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    datetime DATETIME NOT NULL NOT NULL,
    contains TEXT NOT NULL
);

Add doctors:

INSERT INTO Doctor(did, forename, surname, phoneNumber) VALUES (0, 'John', 'Doe', '07842145688');
INSERT INTO Doctor(did, forename, surname, phoneNumber) VALUES (1, 'Edgar', 'Allen Poe', '07221535498');

Add booking:

INSERT INTO Booking(bid, reason, date, time, patient, doctor) VALUES (0, 'reason', '2022-03-31', '14:00:00', 0, 1);

Reset all tables:

DELETE FROM Booking;
DELETE FROM Message;
DELETE FROM Login;
DELETE FROM Patient;
DELETE FROM Doctor;

Drop all tables (use with caution):

DROP TABLE Booking;
DROP TABLE Message;
DROP TABLE Login;
DROP TABLE Patient;
DROP TABLE Doctor;
